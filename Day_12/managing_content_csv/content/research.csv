The effect of device usage on cognitive accuray,abstract ,": Over the past decade, increasing research attention has been devoted to understanding the consequences of the growing tendency of users to rely on mobile devices, in particular smartphones, to accomplish diverse tasks. Such research has repeatedly highlighted the inferior performance of mobile users relative to that of personal computer (PC) users, largely due to lower usability and higher search costs arising from the use of smaller screens. Research, however, has yet to substantively address the information processing tasks without information search. Against this background, we propose that mobile task performance may be inferior in cognitive tasks, even when usability and search costs cannot be used as explanatory mechanisms, due to the predisposition of users to process information differently on different devices. We provide evidence in support of this proposition in two experiments under controlled conditions. We find that mobile users perform worse (less accurately) than PC users do when the tasks demand high cognitive load. By contrast, when the tasks demand low cognitive load, performance is comparable across devices. In so doing, we are able to extend existing explanations of mobile task performance and shed light on the boundary conditions under which mobile use negatively affects task performance"
The effect of device usage on risk avoidance behavior,abstract ,": Phishing has been the most common type of cybercrime in recent years. The fact that phishing attacks require a victim user to collaborate with the offender highlights the importance of users’ avoidance behavior. Against the transition of users from personal computers (PCs) to mobile devices and accumulated evidence of greater heuristic processing in mobile use, this research hypothesizes that mobile users also exhibit a greater tendency to avoid risky behavior. This hypothesis is tested in observational and experimental studies. First, we analyze data from a cybersecurity startup company, which provides security solutions for domestic networks, about online user behavior on all devices in a sample of households. The analysis of about half a million URL requests shows that a smartphone is less likely to be used than a PC to target unsafe URLs. Second, we conduct two online experiments in which device and risk are exogenously manipulated. Consistent with our previous results, the results of these experiments show that mobile users are less likely than PC users to click a risky link. This work contributes to the mobile use literature, as well as to the security and privacy literature, by highlighting device-related boundary conditions in the susceptibility of users to phishing attacks.

The effect of device usage on information disclosure,abstract ,": Drawing on foot-in-the-door theory, we identify two structural mechanisms in sign-up procedures that are hypothesized to increase the willingness of online service users to disclose private information (information disclosure) and to become active users (conversion). The two mechanisms are presenting information items in an ascending privacy-intrusion order (vs. a non-ascending order) and on multiple pages (vs. a single page), both applying the reasoning of gradualism advocated by foot-in-the-door theory. To test these hypothesized effects, as well as the moderating effects of the device being used (mobile vs. PC), we perform two digital experiments. The results of the first experiment—a field experiment conducted in collaboration with an international FinTech startup company that provides digital banking services—provide support for our hypotheses about the positive effects of the two foot-in-the-door mechanisms on information disclosure and conversion, as well as partial support for the effects of the device."
The effect of device usage on online dating,abstract ,": Online dating has replaced traditional offline venues largely due to the structured presentation of visual and verbal information about potential partners. This study shows that including verbal information alongside visual information in online dating profiles affects attractiveness assessments by women more favorably than it affects those by men. These gender differences, however, are mitigated by use of a mobile device instead of a PC. The findings extend the selectivity model, as well as the literature on online dating and mobile use, by highlighting gender differences in processing specific information types and by identifying the device as a boundary condition."
The effect of device usage on online learning,abstract ,": When the covid-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020, educational institutions (schools, colleges, and universities), as well as other organizations engaged in educational or training programs, had to shift to online learning overnight. Face-to-face lectures in a classroom were swiftly replaced by remote online learning on a massive scale. The rapid nature of the shift to online learning meant that many people around the world were forced to learn under suboptimal conditions, which they had little opportunity to improve. In light of these circumstances, our research seeks to shed light on how individuals might achieve positive online learning outcomes, given that such learning must take place under certain constraints. We focus on device availability—a crucial condition for participating in online lessons—and specifically compare between smartphone users and PC users in terms of the efficacy of different lecture formats. We conducted two digital experiments to test the differences in learning result continent to the device of use and lecture format (with or without a break). Our results show that providing users with a break between two parts of a lecture will have a more significant positive effect on the learning outcomes of mobile users than on those of PC users. One possible explanation for these results is the lower attention mobile users have in comparison to PC users."
The effect of online engaement on information revelation,abstract ,": Many content websites seek to encourage user participation, which has been shown to increase user satisfaction and propensity to contribute. Yet this study shows that such encouragement can cause users to expose themselves to potentially harmful consequences, by enhancing their trust in the website and leading them to be more willing to reveal personal information. We perform a series of empirical experiments, utilizing a website called VideoBook, a YouTube-like video browsing platform that provides the opportunity to study users’ behaviors and perceptions in a realistic environment and under lab conditions. We find that users who are exposed to prompts that require them to engage with the website (rate videos) subsequently report higher trust in the site and reveal more personal information, compared with users who are not exposed to such prompts. Exposure to prompts does not affect users’ general attitudes regarding privacy. We test alternative scenarios to attempt to identify the sources of the phenomena, and we link our results to previous work on website-initiated participation and self-perception theory. We discuss both theoretical and policy implications."
